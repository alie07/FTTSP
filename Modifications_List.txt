//SeikoEpsonDll 1.4 : 29/03/2013 (pgy)
//				- Remove the check : Bin = 0 in the seiko epson Dll (see HndBin Function) as it seems 
//				  that the check is done on device that are not tested !!!!!!!!				


//SeikoEpsonDll 1.13 : 28/03/2013 (pgy)
//				- Replace size_t with a int in the HndBin function to avoid the crash in production.

//FTTSP_1_12 (CDE 04/03/2013)
	- DLL SEIKO EPSON: => V1.2
		o Modification of the Poll and Bin function.

	- DLL AETRIMUM modification => V1.3
		o Bug correction on the handler asynchrony management. (HndPoll function). when several sites are awaiting but one is missing, then after the 5 seconds, the test was started with the sites ready. 
                  The correct behavior is to not start the test.

//FTTSP_1_11 (CDE 22/11/2012)

		o Modification of the AETIRUM and MANUAL handler DLL.
	- Details:
		o Configuration class:
			+ Add GetSetupRev method and strSetupRev attribut: to manage the setup file revision.
			+ Add iTestMask attribut to manage the test mask passed to the DLL.
			+ Update the class to manage all the previous modification.
		o FTTSP.h : minor revision increased to 11
		o FTTSPDlg class:

			+ Bugg correction in CheckGatewayData. The nIndex was not well incremented.
		o FTTSPMainWaindow class:
			+ Change the icons linked to the socket tested: now, a cross means "not used", a 'P' means pass and 'F' means fail.
		o LoadProgram class:
			+ Modification of the information passed to the handler: now it is a socket test mask instead of the number of socket under test.
			+ Force UI to be in production mode and not in Engi.
		o SessionMapCods class:
			+ Add the Setup file revision information into the summary generation.
		o SessionSummary class:
			+ Add the Setup file revision information into the summary generation.
